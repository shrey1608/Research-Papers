# Research-Papers
Welcome to the repository of my research papers! This README file will provide you with an overview of the contents of this repository, instructions for navigating through the papers, and additional information about the research.

## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of research papers that I have authored. The papers cover various topics within the field of machine learning and deep learning . Each paper aims to contribute new knowledge, explore innovative ideas, or present novel solutions to existing problems. I hope you find these papers informative and insightful.

## Paper Summaries
Below is a brief summary of each research paper available in this repository:

**Facial Emotion Recognition using Convolution Neural Network**: This paper provides a systematic survey of deep facial emotion recognition (FER) techniques, addressing challenges such as overfitting, emotion-related differences, and incorporating FER into robotics. It includes context information, recommendations for implementation, commonly used datasets, assessment criteria, and competitive results. The main motivation is to improve accuracy in FER models and compare the proposed model with transfer learning for future advancements.

**Comparative Analysis of Psychometric Prediction System**: This paper explores the analysis of social media data to infer personality traits using deep learning techniques. It discusses the prevalent Big Five or OCEAN model and the use of convolutional neural networks for personality prediction. The motivation of the paper is to compare different learning models and provide insights for algorithm selection, avoiding the use of convolutional neural networks. The study aims to offer alternative approaches for personality prediction in the context of social media data analysis.

**Employee Attrition System Using Tree Based Ensemble Method**: This paper addresses the problem of employee attrition and its impact on organizations. It emphasizes the importance of retaining talented employees and highlights the challenges associated with hiring and training new employees. The paper proposes the use of Machine Learning Algorithms, specifically a tree-based Ensemble Model, to identify factors contributing to employee attrition. It reviews the dataset 'IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Performance' and evaluates the effectiveness of the tree-based ensemble approach for predicting and understanding employee attrition.
